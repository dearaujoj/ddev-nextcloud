## What is ddev-nextcloud?

Nextcloud is a self-hosted file sharing and collaboration platform, similar to Dropbox or Google Drive, but with full control over your data.

### Core Features

- **File Management**
 - File sync across devices
 - Secure sharing capabilities
 - Version control

- **Collaboration Tools**
 - Calendar and contacts sync
 - Task management
 - Document collaboration
 - Video/audio chat

- **Extensibility**
 - App ecosystem for additional features
 - Password management
 - Notes and email integration

### Key Benefits

The platform prioritizes privacy and data sovereignty through self-hosting rather than relying on third-party cloud services.

## Components of the repository

* The fundamental contents of the add-on service or other component. For example, in this template there is a [docker-compose.nextcloud.yaml](docker-compose.nextcloud.yaml) file.
* An [install.yaml](install.yaml) file that describes how to install the service or other component.
* A test suite in [test.bats](tests/test.bats) that makes sure the service continues to work as expected.
* [Github actions setup](.github/workflows/tests.yml) so that the tests run automatically when you push to the repository.

## Getting started

1. Choose a good descriptive name for your add-on. It should probably start with "ddev-" and include the basic service or functionality. If it's particular to a specific CMS, perhaps `ddev-<CMS>-servicename`.
2. Create the new template repository by using the template button.
3. Globally replace "nextcloud" with the name of your add-on.
4. Add the files that need to be added to a DDEV project to the repository. For example, you might replace `docker-compose.nextcloud.yaml` with the `docker-compose.*.yaml` for your recipe.
5. Update the `install.yaml` to give the necessary instructions for installing the add-on:

   * The fundamental line is the `project_files` directive, a list of files to be copied from this repo into the project `.ddev` directory.
   * You can optionally add files to the `global_files` directive as well, which will cause files to be placed in the global `.ddev` directory, `~/.ddev`.
   * Finally, `pre_install_commands` and `post_install_commands` are supported. These can use the host-side environment variables documented [in DDEV docs](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users/extend/custom-commands/#environment-variables-provided).

6. Update `tests/test.bats` to provide a reasonable test for your repository. Tests are triggered either by manually executing `bats ./tests/test.bats`, automatically on every push to the repository, or periodically each night. Please make sure to attend to test failures when they happen. Others will be depending on you. Bats is a simple testing framework that just uses Bash. To run a Bats test locally, you have to [install bats-core](https://bats-core.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html) first. Then you download your add-on, and finally run `bats ./tests/test.bats` within the root of the uncompressed directory. To learn more about Bats see the [documentation](https://bats-core.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
7. When everything is working, including the tests, you can push the repository to GitHub.
8. Create a [release](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository) on GitHub.
9. Test manually with `ddev get <owner/repo>`.
10. You can test PRs with `ddev get https://github.com/<user>/<repo>/tarball/<branch>`
11. Update the `README.md` to describe the add-on, how to use it, and how to contribute. If there are any manual actions that have to be taken, please explain them. If it requires special configuration of the using project, please explain how to do those. Examples in [ddev/ddev-solr](https://github.com/ddev/ddev-solr), [ddev/ddev-memcached](https://github.com/ddev/ddev-memcached), and (advanced) [ddev-platformsh](https://github.com/ddev/ddev-platformsh).
12. Update the `README.md` header in Title Case format, for example, use `# DDEV Redis`, not `# ddev-redis`.
13. Add a good short description to your repo, and add the [topic](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/classifying-your-repository-with-topics) "ddev-get". It will immediately be added to the list provided by `ddev get --list --all`.
14. When it has matured you will hopefully want to have it become an "official" maintained add-on. Open an issue in the [DDEV queue](https://github.com/ddev/ddev/issues) for that.

Add-ons were covered in [DDEV Add-ons: Creating, maintaining, testing](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/bnvlv7zswxwm8ix1s5u4t/2023-11-07_DDEV_Add-ons.mp4?rlkey=5cma8s11pscxq0skawsoqrscp&dl=0) (part of the [DDEV Contributor Live Training](https://ddev.com/blog/contributor-training)).

Note that more advanced techniques are discussed in [DDEV docs](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users/extend/additional-services/#additional-service-configurations-and-add-ons-for-ddev).

## How to debug tests (Github Actions)

1. You need an SSH-key registered with GitHub. You either pick the key you have already used with `github.com` or you create a dedicated new one with `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -a 64 -f tmate_ed25519 -C "$(date +'%d-%m-%Y')"` and add it at `https://github.com/settings/keys`.

2. Add the following snippet to `~/.ssh/config`:

```
Host *.tmate.io
    User git
    AddKeysToAgent yes
    UseKeychain yes
    PreferredAuthentications publickey
    IdentitiesOnly yes
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/tmate_ed25519
```
3. Go to `https://github.com/<user>/<repo>/actions/workflows/tests.yml`.

4. Click the `Run workflow` button and you will have the option to select the branch to run the workflow from and activate `tmate` by checking the `Debug with tmate` checkbox for this run.

5. After the `workflow_dispatch` event was triggered, click the `All workflows` link in the sidebar and then click the `tests` action in progress workflow.

7. Pick one of the jobs in progress in the sidebar.

8. Wait until the current task list reaches the `tmate debugging session` section and the output shows something like:

```
106 SSH: ssh PRbaS7SLVxbXImhjUqydQBgDL@nyc1.tmate.io
107 or: ssh -i <path-to-private-SSH-key> PRbaS7SLVxbXImhjUqydQBgDL@nyc1.tmate.io
108 SSH: ssh PRbaS7SLVxbXImhjUqydQBgDL@nyc1.tmate.io
109 or: ssh -i <path-to-private-SSH-key> PRbaS7SLVxbXImhjUqydQBgDL@nyc1.tmate.io
```

9. Copy and execute the first option `ssh PRbaS7SLVxbXImhjUqydQBgDL@nyc1.tmate.io` in the terminal and continue by pressing either <kbd>q</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd>.

10. Start the Bats test with `bats ./tests/test.bats`.
